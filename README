This is a python module that provides a kinda pythonic interface to Bugzilla
over XMLRPC.

It was originally written specifically for Red Hat's Bugzilla instance, but
it is intended to work with any bugzilla instance. More usage the better,
we would be happy to help get things working with the bugzilla instance you
care about.

It also includes a 'bugzilla' commandline client which can be used for quick,
ad-hoc bugzilla jiggery-pokery. It's also a good API reference since we lack
we lack real documentation :)

Comments, suggestions, and - most of all - patches are welcomed and encouraged,
please send all to the mailing list
